# Reconstruction-of-geological-images-using-analytical-edge-and-object-models
Read Me:
To use the code you can easily run useBinaryImReconst.m in Matlab. The images sampled from the binary images shown in the paper at different sampling rates are readily available in this package. To use another image as input create a variable named Is with “nan”s at unknown locations and zeros or ones at sampled locations and save it in a mat file. Then load it in useBinaryImReconst.m. 
Parameter setting:
The parameters can be set in lines 34-41 of useBinaryImReconst.m.
